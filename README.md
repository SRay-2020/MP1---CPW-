#### Business Goals:  

The main goal of this project is to create a static website for a business which has operated in traditional trading methods (high street) and has been forced to migrate its business to the online sphere to remain economically viable during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  It aims to maintain the services which it has previously provided in a way which is informative and accessible to its target audience/customer base. Furthermore, it will attempt to create a space which is conducive to communication and engagement, where those in the art community can still feel a sense of inclusivity and interconnection. 

*Target audience:*  

-Those within pottery community 

-Pottery hobbyists 

-General public

### **Scope -** 

This project will be a Minimal Viable Product containing the most important core content that is required.  


#### Functional specifications -  

* Navigation 

* Display of work 

* Contact 

* Social media links 

#### Content specifications -  

* Information about the business (incl methods and ethos) 

* Engaging visuals  

* Product listings 

* Classes/Workshop listings 


**SCTRUCTURE** 

The website is laid out in a very straight forward style, it contains four pages and there is a focus of all pages to lead to a direct contact to the owners of the business. The four pages are :  

1. Home/Landing Page 

2. Store Page 

3. Classes Page  

4. Contact Page 

The function of the landing page is to give some background information about the business and the various ways in which users can interact with the workshop. The second page is a very 
straightforward store page which presents three items in a clear manner and encourages the user to make contact to inquire about the saleable items. The third page is the classes page, this page offers three levels of classes for prospective customers and gives a short blurb about each one and their unique selling points. It also suggests that users make contact directly via the form on the contact page. The last page is a very simple contact page which gets some basic information from users and prospective customers.   All pages have been designed to be as clear and accessible as possible and a welcoming space to all users and navigation that gets the user to where they want to be.  

**SKELETON** 

Wireframes for Mobile and Desktop/Tablet  

* Landing Page 

* Store Page 

* Classes Page 

* Contact Page 

Differences between final design and wireframes:  

Landing Page -  

1. Mobile: There were no big differences between the wireframe for this page and the final design. There was a background card added to the main title at the beginning of the page to add more colour and depth to this page and also some icons given to the three heading (About, Workshop, Ethos) to make it more interesting to the user.  

2. Desktop/Tablet:  There were some changes between the wireframe for this page and the final design. The styling changed to align all text to the left of the page and the images to the right-hand side. This gave a cleaner finish and was more visually aesthetic. The same changes as above were also included (title card and section icons).   

Store Page -  

1. Mobile: There were virtually no changes between wireframe and finished site.  

2. Desktop/Tablet: There were virtually no changes between wireframe and finished site. 

Classes Page - 

1. Mobile: There were virtually no changes between wireframe and finished site.  

2. Desktop/Tablet: There were some changes made to this page from the initial skeleton design. A decision was made to keep all images on the right-hand side and all the calendar images to the left. This gave a more consistent experience for the user.  

Contact Page -  

1. Mobile: There were virtually no changes between wireframe and finished site.  

2. Desktop/Tablet: There were virtually no changes between wireframe and finished site. 

**SURFACE** 

Typography -  

The type style that was selected was Castoro – it is a Celtic style font which is consistant with the thematic styling of the workshop and page.  

Colour scheme - 

The colour scheme that was used is one developed specifically for this project using an online colour scheme generator (Coolers) and it again is trying to be consistent with the Celtic styling and meet the user's expectations.  

The dark font colour was taken from this scheme and contrasts well against the lighter colours. 

Images -  

There is a focus on the visual aspect of the work produced by this business so imagery is used throughout to invoke a strong sense of artistic value and feelings.

**TECNOLOGIES USED** 

HTML – For creating website 

Css – For styling website 

Bootstrap – Used Bootstrap grid system, navbar, carousel and called classes 

Adobe XD – For creating wireframes 

Adobe Photoshop – For editing images to consistent sizes and adjusting styles 

Git – Used for Version control 

Gitpod – For code editing and testing 

GitHub – For storing repository  

Chrome Dev Tools – For editing changes in real time and checking styles in different media sizes 

Chrome Lighthouse – For checking page performance 

W3C CSS  - For validating CSS code  

W3C HTML – For validating and ensuring HTML code was correct/valid.  

Coolers (website) - For creating a custom colour palette for project    

FreeFormatter (website) - For validating HTML code 

AutoPrefixer Online – For CSS parsing and adding vendor prefixes 

AmIResponsive (website) - To ensure site is responsive and create mockup 

**TESTING**

**Code tests** - 

The CSS code was passed through W3C CSS Validator and final version contained no errors. It was also passed through AutoPrefixer Online to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes. 

The HTML code was passed through W3C HTML Validator and FreeFormatter.com to ensure final version contained no errors.  

**Dev tests** -  

Chrome Developer Tools -  

This project used Chrome Development tools throughout to alter, adjust and finalise styles.  

Chrome Lighthouse -  

Was used towards the latter half of the project to ensure that there were no outstanding issues with source code.  Below is the final report from Lighthouse.  There are and remain obvious issues with performance of website and further knowledge will need to be aquired before author can adequately make the changes needed to improve this (by creating responsively sized images) Unfortunately time and skills do not allow this at the current time and a decision was made to keep high quality images contained in project for main objectives. 

 

**Function tests** -  

All buttons and links were tested manually from all pages and achieved the desired goal  

 

**Response tests** -  

Site was manually tested at all breaking points to ensure than there was a consistent aesthetic at all sizes of display across all devices. Also used AmIResponsive. Com for same.

Site was tested across Chrome, Safari and Firefox to ensure workability on most popular browsers.

**IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES** 
At the beginning I struggled to create a collapsible hamburger menu that was inline with my logo and not beneath. This issue was temporarily resolved by using manual styles to pad around the sides to create something that was useable for my desired effect but this issue persisted until a decision was made to revert back to an older version of Bootstrap (from 5.0 to 4.5). This resolved the issue for me and the Bootstrap styles that I could not override manually on version 5.0 were set to a style which was suitable for the desired design.  The older version worked correctly and I proceeded with the project. 

An issue with the footer arose and I needed to revert to an older version and replace all code in Footer and then re-style for the HTML Validator to accept my code as being valid. This thankfully resolved the issue.
