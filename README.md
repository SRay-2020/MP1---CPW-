#### Business Goals:

It aims to maintain the services which it has previously provided in a way which is informative and accessible to its target audience/customer base. Furthermore, it will attempt to create a space which is conducive to communication and engagement, where those in the art community can still feel a sense of inclusivity and interconnection. 

Target audience:  

-Those within pottery community 

-Pottery hobbyists 

-General public
